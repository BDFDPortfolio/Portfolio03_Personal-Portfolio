        <h2 class="major">Project Name: E-commerce Website Development
        </h2>
        <p>Last project is about a start-up company is looking to develop a new
            e-commerce website that will allow customers to purchase products
            online. The website will have a variety of features, including a
            product catalog, shopping cart, user accounts, and payment
            processing. We want the website to be visually appealing and easy to
            use, with a clean and modern design.</p>
        <p>The project will be divided into several phases, starting with the
            planning and design phase, followed by the development phase, and
            finally the testing and launch phase. During the planning and design
            phase, we will work with the development team to create wireframes
            and mockups of the website, as well as define the technical
            specifications and requirements.</p>
        <p>In the development phase, the website will be built using a
            combination of programming languages, frameworks, and technologies,
            including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue, Node.js, Python and MySQL. The
            website will be developed using an agile development methodology,
            with frequent check-ins and updates from the development team.</p>
        <p> During the testing and launch phase, the website will be rigorously
            tested to ensure that all features are working as intended and that
            there are no bugs or errors. Once the website has been thoroughly
            tested, it will be launched and made available to customers.</p>
