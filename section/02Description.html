        <h2 class="major">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi there! My name is BDFD, and I'm a web developer with a
            passion for creating beautiful and functional websites. With 3 of
            experience in the industry, I specialize in Python, Node.js,
            Javascript, HTML and Css. I love working on projects that challenge
            me and allow me to learn new things, and I'm always looking for ways
            to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and
            technologies.
            When I'm not coding, you can usually find me explore the Cloud World
            technologies. I'm a firm believer in work-life balance and strive to
            maintain a healthy lifestyle both
            mentally and physically.
            Overall, I'm a driven and creative individual who is always looking
            for ways to grow and improve. I'm excited to see where my career as
            a web developer will take me, and I can't wait to collaborate with
            other like-minded professionals along the way.</p>
